    <h2>About Energy Performance Certificates</h3>
    <p>In May 2010, the UK Government dropped the requirement for Home Information Packs (Hips) for residents in England and Wales. In their place they introduced the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) which became mandatory for all households, and business properties.</p>
    <p class='text-danger'>You cannot sell or rent a property in England or Wales without an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC), for penalty is a fine upto Â£5000.</p>

    <h2>The Idea behind Energy Performance Certificates (EPC)</h3>
    <p>Buildings are almost responsible for 50% of the UK's energy consumption, which is twice that of cars and planes.</p>
    <p>Energy Performance Certificates have been adopted to bring about greater awareness of energy efficiency and what we can do reduce carbon emissions. This has evolved from the Government's acceptance of the 'Kyoto Agreement' and the EU's ' Energy Performance of Buildings Directive'.</p>
